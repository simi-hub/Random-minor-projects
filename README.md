#Title: My Coding Playground

#Description:

Welcome to my coding playground! This is where I keep all kinds of projects I work on to get better at coding. You'll find everything from tiny pieces of code that show how certain things work, to bigger projects that help me dive deeper into programming.

I also write about what I'm thinking as I code, problems I run into, and how I solve them. I hope it helps you as much as it helps me!

I'm all about learning and getting better, so I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas. Let's help each other grow!

*Projects include*:

Credit-card-checker: `This program basically validates credit card numbers using Luhm's algorithm. It checks to make sure that a credit card number is valid. It is basically a short file to verify whether or not a credit card Number is valid, and if not, what company it's from. The source of this project is codeacademy. Read more about this project in the project guide directory under this project's folder.`
