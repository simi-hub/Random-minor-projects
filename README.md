#Title: My Coding Playground

#Description:

Welcome to my coding playground! This is where I keep all kinds of projects I work on to get better at coding. You'll find everything from tiny pieces of code that show how certain things work, to bigger projects that help me dive deeper into programming.

I also write about what I'm thinking as I code, problems I run into, and how I solve them. I hope it helps you as much as it helps me!

I'm all about learning and getting better, so I'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas. Let's help each other grow!

*Projects include*:

Credit-card-checker: `This program basically validates credit card numbers using Luhm's algorithm. This is quite useful for websites that need to validate credit card numbers before purchase. It checks to make sure that a credit card number is valid. It is basically a short file to verify whether or not a credit card Number is valid, and if not, what company it's from. The source of this project is codeacademy. Read more about this project in the project guide directory under this project's folder.`

Lodash-library: `This program recreates some of the functionality of the lodash library in javascript. Yes. I know lodash isnt used and very popular anymore, but I thought it would be quite interesting to see how my thought process would be to implement some of the functionality in this library. The source of this project is codeacademy. Read more about this project in the project guide directory under this project's folder`

Mystery-organism: `This project was quite interesting because it delved into biology a bit. The program for this project simulates the genetic sequence of an organism called Pila Aequor. It pretty mutates the DNA sequence of this organism, computes the survival rate of the organism, and is able to compare its genetic sequence with another organism to check if it belong to same species.The source of this project is codeacademy.
