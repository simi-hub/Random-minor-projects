**Project Goals**

In this project, I simply recreate some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. Unfortunately, lodash is not quite popular and used anymore like before. Radash is a more popular library used by developers. However, I still choose to do it for critical thinking skills. jk, I just dont have a life ~lol~

Implementing the methods from lodash is an exercise  that helps with problem-solving and a great way to understand how the methods work!

**Object include**\
